T&C
I understand that the animal remains the property of LSAH while under my care.

I am prepared to accept LSAH's decision about euthanizing and animal on humane grounds.

I agree to keep and care for the animal as instructed by the vet or foster care supervisor. 

I accept that foster animals may cause damage to property...[responsibility]

I agree to allow a LSAH representative to make a home visit to ensure suitability of the home.  This will be carried about at a mutually agreed time prior to commencement of fostering.

I agree for a police check to be done.
